# Enumerations and sealed classes/interfaces

This lesson covers the use of enumerations and sealed classes/interfaces in Kotlin. These constructs are used to represent a fixed number of possible values or types in a type-safe manner. Enumerations are used to define a set of named constants, while sealed classes/interfaces are used to represent restricted class hierarchies.
